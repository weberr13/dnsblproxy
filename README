DNSBL proxy
-----------

This is a project designed to allow admins to setup an adaptive dns
blacklist for use with sendmail(and others) to slow the load of spam.  The
system is designed to allow data from many dnsbl's to be used, while
off setting the delay associated with a string of dns lookups for each
sendmail connection.

sendmail/
  - Here you will find mc files for the necessary syslog entries used by
the utilities to find suspicious ips for investigation.

milter/
  - Here is a perl milter that implements most of the rfc rules(and some
others) but does the bl querries directly on suspicious hosts.  Clamav and
spamassassin are also tossed in for good measure. 

bin/
  - not binary, but executable perl and born scripts.

man/ 
  - man pages(in development)

doc/ 
  - what do you think is in the doc dir?

Please read the INSTALL file for the details for setting up a bind zone,
syslog and sendmail for all of this to work properly.
