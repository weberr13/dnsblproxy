You will need to copy the m4 files from here to your cf/hacks dir inside
your sendmail build tree.  Include the following in your cf.mc file and
rebuild:

HACK(syslog, `-LINFO')dnl
HACK(require_rdns-log)
HACK(block_bad_helo)
FEATURE(enhdnsbl, `DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME', `"550 Mail from block-listed site "$&{client_addr} " refused, contact CONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE"', `t', `127.0.0.2.')

the DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME and CONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE should be set to the name of
your own dnsbl zone you have setup, and the contact address that is on an
unflitered machine for complaint contacts.

keep in mind that you will need a server that doesn't have the following
rules listed(at least for now) so that your contact address will work.
I am working on a modified enhdnsbl m4 that will be in the recpto area of
the cf file, allowing an exception for the CONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE user and
since it will be after the block_bad_helo the auto whitelisting fuctions of
the dnsblmanager will work properly as well.  Till that time you can hack 
your cf file by hand(experts only please, not everyone should start editing
sendmail.cf's):

1) find the dnsbl lines in the check_relay area of the sendmail.cf and
comment them out, they should look like this:

# DNS based IP address spam list DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME
R$*	$: $&{client_addr}
R$-.$-.$-.$-	$: <?> $(ednsbl $4.$3.$2.$1.DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME. $: OK $) R<?>OK  $: OKSOFAR
R<?>$+<TMP>	$#error $@ 4.7.1 $: "451 Temporary lookup failure of " $&{client_addr} " at DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME"
R<?>127.0.0.2.	$#error $@ 5.7.1 $: "550 Mail from block-listed site " $&{client_addr} " refused, contact CONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE"

2) drop down to the SLocal_check_rcpt area, and after the HELO logger lines
add the following(watch the tabs, please):

R$*	$: $&{client_addr}
R$*	$: $>A < $1 > <?> <+ Connect> <>
R<$={Accept}> $*	$@ $1		return value of lookup
R$*	$: $&{client_name}
R$*	$: $>D < $1 > <?> <+ Connect> <>
R<$={Accept}> $*	$@ $1		return value of lookup
R$*	$: $&{rcpt_addr}
RCONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE	$@OK
R$*	$: $&{client_addr}
R$-.$-.$-.$-	$: <?> $(ednsbl $4.$3.$2.$1.DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME. $: OK $)$ R<?>OK	$: OKSOFAR
R<?>$+<TMP>	$#error $@ 4.7.1 $: "451 Temporary lookup failure of "$&{client_addr} " at DNSBL_DOMAIN_NAME"
R<?>127.0.0.2.	$#error $@ 5.7.1 $: "550 Mail from block-listed site "$&{client_addr} " refused, contact CONTACT_ADDRESS_HERE"
